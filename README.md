# vipps-demo
Learn how to integrate your Spring Boot application with Vipps payment.

In this demo, you will learn how to set up and use Vipps payment services in a Spring Boot application.

This project contains two sub-modules; [application](./application/README.md) and [library](./library/README.md)
- where the application module contains a running Spring Boot web application, hosting a very simple shopping cart,
and the library module contains a service API which allows your application to quickly integrate with the Vipps eCom service.
